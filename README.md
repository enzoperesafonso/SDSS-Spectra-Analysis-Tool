# SDSS-Spectra-Analysis-Tool

This Python script is designed to import one-dimensional (1D) spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6 and perform a comprehensive analysis for classification purposes. The script efficiently fits the continuum, as well as all the emission and absorption lines present in the spectra, enabling accurate classification of astronomical objects.
