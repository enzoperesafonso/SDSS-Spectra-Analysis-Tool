# SDSS-Spectra-Analysis-Tool

This Python script is designed to import one-dimensional (1D) spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6 and perform a comprehensive analysis for classification purposes. The script efficiently fits the continuum, as well as all the emission and absorption lines present in the spectra, enabling accurate classification of astronomical objects.

Features:

Seamless integration with SDSS Data Release 6: The script effortlessly retrieves 1D spectra data from the SDSS archive, ensuring easy access to a vast collection of astronomical observations.

Continuum fitting: The script utilizes advanced algorithms to fit the continuum of the spectra, allowing for precise separation of the underlying continuum from emission and absorption lines.

Line fitting: By employing sophisticated line-fitting techniques, the script effectively identifies and characterizes emission and absorption lines within the spectra. This enables accurate measurement of line parameters, such as flux, line width, and centroid.

Classification capabilities: With the continuum and line fitting in place, the script provides a robust foundation for classifying astronomical objects. The extracted line features can be used to determine the nature of the observed objects, such as galaxies, quasars, or stars.

Key functionalities:

Import SDSS 1D spectra: Easily retrieve and load 1D spectra from the SDSS Data Release 6 using the script's built-in functions.
Continuum fitting: Employ advanced algorithms to accurately fit the underlying continuum of the spectra, ensuring precise separation from emission and absorption lines.
Line identification and fitting: Detect and fit emission and absorption lines present in the spectra, allowing for the extraction of crucial line parameters.
Classification: Leverage the extracted line features to classify astronomical objects into different categories, enhancing our understanding of the observed universe.
